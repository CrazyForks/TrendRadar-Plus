# Windsurf Instructions

If your Windsurf setup supports a dedicated rules file, point it to these canonical docs:
- `docs/ai/AI_CONTEXT.md`
- `docs/ai/AI_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/README.md`

OpenSpec workflow authority:
- `openspec/AGENTS.md`

Notes:
- Do NOT add secrets (tokens/webhooks/passwords) to the repo or docs.
